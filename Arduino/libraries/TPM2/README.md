# TPM2 Arduino library

TPM2 is a protocol designed for LED (matrices) communications.
Details about TPM2 can be found [here](https://www.ledstyles.de/index.php?thread/18969-tpm2-protokoll-zur-matrix-lichtsteuerung/) (german) or [here](https://gist.github.com/jblang/89e24e2655be6c463c56) (english).
This is a generic Arduino implementation of the protocol, it uses the serial part only, also called TPM2.serial. It should work on any
Arduino.

If you are searching for network support, take a look at the alternatives below.

## Limitations

The amount of free RAM defines the number or LEDs. An Arduino Uno with 2 KiByte RAM can only handle a finite number of LEDs. Use a bigger Arduino (e.g. Mega 2560) for more LEDs.

## Installation

As usual, place this repository into the Arduino library folder,
e.g. `~/Documents/Arduino/libraries/` for macOS or `~/Arduino/libraries/` for Linux. Or use the [Arduino-IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries#toc4) to import the zip-file.

## Hardware

Smart LEDs like WS2812 (NeoPixels) or similar devices need a lot of current. In most cases 10 LEDs will exceed the capabilities of a USB 2 port.

Short example for 3-color (RGB) LEDs in full white.

|LED(s)|Current|
|-----:|------:|
|    1 |  60 mA|
|   10 | 600 mA|
|  100 |6000 mA|

WS2812 are 5 Volt LEDs, so driving the data-Pin with 5 V is necessary. In most cases 3.3 V will work, too. But that is not good engineering.
